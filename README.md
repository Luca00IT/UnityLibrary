This is a collection of my libraries that I have used for my projects on Unity.

## What is Unity?

"**Unity** is a **game and simulation development platform** widely used in the interactive software industry. Founded in 2005, **Unity Technologies** created Unity, a **cross-platform game engine** that allows developers to create 2D, 3D, virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) games for a wide range of platforms, including PCs, consoles, mobile devices and even Web platforms.

Key features of Unity include its **flexibility, ease of use and ability to support game creation for a wide range of devices and operating systems.** Developers can write game code using **C# or JavaScript**, and Unity offers an integrated development environment (IDE) that simplifies design, programming, asset creation, and project management.

Unity has been widely adopted by both independent developers and large game development studios and has been used to create a number of popular and successful games. In addition to games, Unity is also used to develop simulations, training applications, AR/VR experiences, architectural designs, and more. Its versatility and active developer community make it a favorite platform for creating interactive content in a variety of areas." -source [Wikipedia]

## What is a script?

A **script** is a set of instructions or commands written in a specific programming language to perform a set of tasks or automate certain actions within a software or computer system. Scripts are used in a wide range of contexts, including software development, systems administration, process automation, and more.

## Then... what is UnityLibrary?

**UnityLibrary** is a **GitHUB repository** containing lots of libraries I have personally used in my own projects and make available to everyone.
